## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Driven by my interest in interdisciplinary programs handling IT, management and technology, I'm pursuing masters in **Energy Informatics**. On completion of this masters I want to be a part of the evolving energy market, as I believe that it is a thriving research area within the IT community. 
I did my bachelor’s degree in **Electronics and Communication** Engineering and then I worked for 3 years in India. Initially I worked in business development, customer interaction and then as Software Tester with emphasis on Automation Testing for 8 months.

### Expectation from H&B Automation <a name="Expectation"></a>
During my bachelor's course, as an extension to my B.Tech mini-project ‘Light controlled digital fan regulator’ I had put forward the possibility of a Smart-room where all the electronics appliances can be controlled centrally and smartly. I hope to realize the same. 

### Strength and weaknesses <a name="strength"></a>

#### Feasibility:
Technologies exist but not economical or practical for things like Holographic display 

#### Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
- Privacy and security is a concern
- Public access and vulnarability is possible
- Funny
- Some concepts does not seem worth the effort of automating


## New Tools <a name="git"></a>
- git
- Kanban
- Matrix
- Etcher
- MobaXterm

**Challenge**: A lot of new platforms. Many tabs open and its a mess initially. But slowly getting a hold of it. 

Team members helped each other undertand things better. 

## Internet of Things (IoT) <a name="iot"></a>

[The Internet of things - IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data.Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure. 

### Domains (included areas):
- Medical & Healthcare
- Transportation
- Manufacturing
- Energy Management
- Security

### Typical devices (appliance or controller)
- Amazon Dash Button
- Amazon Echo
- Doorbell
- Intelligent lights
- Voice controled devices

## Practical Sessions <a name="practicals"></a>

### 1. Installation on Raspberry Pi from Pre-Prepared Image <a name="pi"></a>

Did installation along with a group member.

Downloaded the pre-prepared Raspberry Pi image & wrote the image to a sd-card with https://etcher.io/ .

Note: Use at least 8GB class-10 sd-card

*Issue Faced*: System not detecting the sd-card even after several trials. 

**Solution**: Used another card-reader and it worked fine.


Challenge: Time consuming 

Changed values: 
- uiot_ap_name: smarthome
- uiot_ap_password: internetofthings123

Put the sd-card into a Raspberry Pi 3 and powered it up. Also connected the LAN cable to it for internet.

Connected my laptop and mobile to this wifi network.

Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh ssh -X pi@192.168.12.1 and password ulnoiot. Upgraded it.

Run the command ulnoiot upgrade to make sure that the latest version of ulnoiot is used.

### 2. Make pw-less ssh work on pi <a name="psw"></a>

Did it on a group member's laptop referring to https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md.

**Issue Faced**: Should fix a bug in MacOS ssh 

**Solution**: .profile      display     :0

**Alternative Solution**: Just **Restart** the Mac

Tried the same on my Windows laptop but some troubles, so with the help of the lecturer implemented pw-less ssh work on pi.


### 3. Switch led <a name="led"></a>

A group member did it and shared the knowledge. Tried to do the same at home but could not!

**Issue Faced**: Pi wifi not connecting on Laptop, but connecting on phone.


Tried Restart, re-set, troubleshoot etc but it didn't work


## Extras <a name="extra"></a>


#### Some useful Commands learned 


ctrl A H for Help page with more commands


ctrl A Q to quit session


ctrl A K to kill session


sudo editor to edit

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


## Card Reader <a name="CardReader"></a>

**Issue**:The device not getting powered up 


**Solution**: upgraded and reinitialize Pi


**Mystery** : Chirantha did upgrades & it showed message saying upgraded but no trace of that upgrade was listed when the professor checked!


### RFID Connection<a name="Card"></a>
Connected the wemos d1 mini and the rfid-rc522 board as follows:

3v3 - 3.3V
d8  - sda
d7  - MOSI
d6  - MISO
d5  - SCK
d0  - RST
G   - GND

Initialised and added the device to node3


**Command:**  Special command to connect the device RC522(The card reader) to the node
 ``` d("mfrc522","reader",d0,datasize=0) ```
``` r=d("mfrc522","r",d0) ```

**Note:** datasize is optional parameter but if initialized as 0 we can detect anything, otherwise it is set to the default value.


**Result:** Success. Read two sample cards.

The id value read: f9813ad597

## General Issues & solutions<a name="issue"></a>

**Issue:** Was working with MobaX portable version, but it is creating trouble and is very unstable

**Solution**: Installed MobaX Home edition


**Issue:** When two devices connected in series with the Py, cannot identify which device is being detected by the Py

**Solution**: The help gave the following solution:


Syntax: initialize [serial_port] [noflash] [noupdate]

initialize must be called from a node directory and reads its configuration from there.
It looks for a locally (i.e. via serial) connected board matching the node
description.

It flashes the board with ulnoiot's version of micropython (if noflash is given,
this step is skipped).
It then sets or overwrites wifi and encryption data, respective to the current
node configuration folder.
Then, it calls a local/serial update on it and installs initial system
user-space software.
Then it calls a network deploy to copy the user folder and autostart to it.
The last two steps fail, if the node router and mqtt broker are not available.
Running deploy noupdate again (when router and mqtt broker become avaialable)
fixes/finishes this.

serial_port: can be empty, usb0, usb1, or acm0, acm1, ...



**Result:** Tried initialize usb1 
But this didn't work as explained in help!


## autostart.py configured<a name="auto"></a>

Watched video for autostart.py and tried it in nodes.

**Result:** working 


**Knowledge transfer:** Coveyed the tasks completed to Elvin and Chirantha and helped them to do the same by staying back after the class


## Plan for Debate<a name="debate"></a>
Planned to meet up and discuss individual points on debate. </b>
**work:** Find points for and aganist the motion for debate
 
 ## Challenges: <a name="challenge"></a>
 - The gropu mates were absent for half of the class. 
 - A lot of time spend on solving issues
 - Staying back, working at home etc is not very helpful as getting stuck at somepoint and feel so out of resources 
 - Very time consuming task as each step involves a lot of research
 
 ## Extra Commands<a name="extra"></a>
- ```ctrl A N``` for new window in command page 
- ```ctrl O``` to navigate from one window to next
- ```ctrl A T``` to name a window/bash
- ```ctrl A -> or ctrl A <-``` for moving from one window to another in command page
- ```ctrl C``` for interrupt in command page
- Use cd instead of mc
- ```onboardled.init( Pin.OUT ```) this can be used to identify which node the device belongs to
- ```onboardled.on()```
- ```onboardled.off()```
- ```dmesg``` to check the devices connected 

## Debate<a name="deb"></a>

Everybody should use Home Automation. True or False?

- Collected points from different sources
- Did team discussion
- Shared discussed points in Matrix
- Chika created tasks in Kanbanflow for Debate plans
- Researched and prepared personal statements for 3 mins long
- Team met again 
- Did mock debate
- Did actual debate recording
- Researched and prepared personal statements for 5 mins long


> "Home automation" refers specifically to things in your home that can be programmed to function automatically. In the past years, those automations were pretty basic, like the lamp timers, programmable thermostats and so on. But that's being changing with big and small companies foreseeing the future and coming up with a variety of devices aimed at mainstream consumers.

>Shop around, and you'll find gadgets designed to help you sleep better, self-making bed, smart shower, smart home piggy bank, devices that smarten up your home entertainment system and even connected tools for more intelligent gardening. For elderly ppl north California. The possibilities are immense, and even controlling these devices have option like voice control, gesture detection, touch, smartphones, apps etc.

>If all these sounds expensive, a new roof to avoid heat or a central AC unit will cost even more, its not that outrageous. So you just have to decide if you are comfortable with a home that listens.. so you don’t waste your money.. 
And also, in the past three years, Its seen that the prices of IoT device is coming down as the competition and the demand is increasing. With big names like Apple, Amazon, Google, GE and Microsoft, there is so much competition in the market and manufacturers are getting increasingly creative in order to stand out from the crowd, which is one of the main reasons that the smart home has diversified as quickly as it has. The market experts predict that the smart home's market share will be worth tens of billions within the next few years.

>If you're a little uncertain about taking a big leap towards home automation, there are plenty of smart, affordable entry points that offer surprisingly high levels of functionality, making it easy to experiment and figure out what you want from your connected home. It's a low-risk way to dip your foot into smart home waters, and if you like it, finding compatible gadgets that make it even smarter isn't difficult at all.

>Also, Smart hubs are designed to control multiple devices, even ones from different manufacturers. This gives a centralization and integration. A good hub can integrate every smart thing in your home into a single, seamless home automation experience, and offer consolidated controls within a single app.
In general, smart home manufacturers see the value in keeping things somewhat open, and many go out of their way to embrace third-party hubs and smart home platforms as a means of providing compatibility with other gadgets. This means that you've got a lot of options. And a variety to choose from, each compatible with one another. 

>A recent study by Intel shows that we are on the brink of a smart-home boon, with growing number of consumers. And we are expecting to see at least one smart-home device in every home by 2025. I think it is the future, and I’m confident that smart homes would become as common as smartphones within the next decade and its not wise to oppose this inevitable change.

## KNX Tutorial

[Register](https://my.knx.org/account/register)
KNX ETS5 eCampus
basic concepts of the KNX bus
KNX is a standardized communication protocol for intelligent buildings. 
devices and electric assets are connected via the BUS which runs on 29 Volts.
All BUS devices can be programmed with one common tool
 
 
Basically, a KNX system requires the following components:

Power Supply for the power of the installation
Sensors (push buttons, thermostats, air speed meters etc.) that generate commands as telegrams
Actuators (switch relays for lights, blinds etc.) that receive the telegrams and perform certain actions
The BUS that connects all Sensors and Actuators

P-2

KNX is designed to be independent of any particular hardware platform.
most common transmission medium in KNX is twisted pair
It is possible to combine - by default normally incompatible media - via KNX media couplers.

p-3

The smallest entity within the KNX topology is a line, respectively a line segment. A line can contain a maximum of 64 devices. This is enough for most small scale projects. 

- up to 15 lines can be combined within one area - connected via a main line.Line Coupler. 
- it is also possible to connect up to 15 areas to a backbone. Single areas are connected to the backbone line via a Backbone Coupler. 
- KNX end devices may be connected anywhere in this topology. Up to 255 KNX end devices may be addressed in any sub- network. KNX end devices may be numbered from 1 to 255. But KNX end devices may NOT have device number 0. 
-Each KNX device (Backbone Coupler, Line Coupler, KNX end device ...) must have an Individual Address. This Individual Address is unique throughout the complete topology. 

Example:

- The first device we need to install is the power supply. A KNX BUS needs to be provided with a 29 V direct current.
- The actual circuit breakers are called actuators. They typically come as multi channel switch acutators, for example as a 4-fold switch actuator that is equipped with 16 ampere relays.
- Push buttons sensors consist of a universal flush-mounted bus coupler and a bus end device. Both devices have to be from the same manufacturer.
- The push button is put onto the bus coupler. The connection is established by a 10-pin connector, the so-called "Physical External Interface".
- Last but not least, we need to connect the high voltage current. The power supply as well as the switch actuator get wired to the power circuit.
- Now, we connect the consumer, in our case the one light.
- With the help of a PC running ETS5, all bus devices can be programmed. Afterwards, the function-check takes place – now it’s your turn to test the system.

## BACnet by Anastasiia 

BACnet is a communications protocol for Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks that leverage the ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO 16484-5 standard protocol.

BACnet was designed to allow communication of building automation and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control (HVAC), lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform.
