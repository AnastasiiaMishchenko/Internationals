My name is Rosemary Josy Poovattil and I'm from India. Driven by my interest in interdisciplinary programs handling IT, management and technology, I'm pursuing masters in Energy Informatics. On completion of this masters I want to be a part of the evolving energy market, as I believe that it is a thriving research area within the IT community. 
I did my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and then I worked for 3 years in India. Initially I worked in business development, customer interaction and then as Software Tester with emphasis on Automation Testing for 8 months.
