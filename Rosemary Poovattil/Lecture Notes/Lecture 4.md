### Lock<a name="lock"></a>
- Connected the wemos d1 mini and the lock
- Initialised and added the device to node2
- **Command:**  Special command to connect the lock to the node
 
 ``` d("out", "lock", d0, "off", "on") ``` 

``` devices["lock"].evaluate("on") ```
- Saved the commands to aurostart.py

**Result:** Success. Lock is opening and closing.


Tried mqtt to combilne card reader and lock
 ```mqtt_action n4/reader anychange xyz mqtt_send n1/lock/set```


**Result:** Failed. Not working
**Note:** 
- Tried different combinations but still not working
- Tried to operate lock using button, but not working
- Asked Mona and Thomas, they said they didn't use mqtt and shared the function for NodeRed

>var idArray= msg.payload.split(" ");
var id = idArray[1];
if(id === "dab93ad58c"){
    msg.payload = "on";
}else{
    msg.payload = "off";
}
return msg;


**Result:** Failed. Not working
