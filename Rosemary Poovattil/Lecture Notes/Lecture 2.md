### MQTT: M2M Communication <a name="m2m"></a>

- Machine to machine communication  
- Can be implemented anywhere, not necessarily in IoT only

Framework for creating network communication. predate of IoT. -Specific channels, msg passing. Subscribe hierarchy. (C# - python program communication)

## Practical: <a name="prac"></a>
- [x] Switch led on one Wemos D1 Mini with sending mqtt command on pi
- [x] Use button to switch led

### Switch led 
Followed the instructions given in video. No big issues.

Did along with Chirantha. For command details click [here](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Chirantha%20Peramunage-_/IoT%20Lecture%20Logs/lecture2.md#Practical_Session)

### Light turn on/off using Button
Tried Button alone in a node and saw the status publishing when button pressed and when not pressed.
To combine the two nodes (LED and Button) we use mqtt.

**Issue Faced**: Pi WiFi not connecting on Laptop, but connecting on phone.

**Solution**: Just **renamed** the wifi name

Commands used to edit name


 ``` sudo editor/boot/config.txt ``` 
 
 
``` sudo reboot```

## Points to remember: <a name="notes"></a>

- To work with a Wemos we should first *initialize* it
- While initializing make sure the respective Wemos is connected directly to the Pi in series port
- Once initialised, use ``console`` command to enter the respective node
- If the Wemos is connected to the Pi we can use the command ``console_serial``

Installed matrix for the common chatroom.


**Mistake**: Didn't 'Commit changes' in git. Thus lost the notes written during class
