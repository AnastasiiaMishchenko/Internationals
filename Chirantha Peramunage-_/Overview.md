### Student's comments / Course Overview <a name= "overview"></a>

From my personal point of view, looking back at what I did and achieved during the course study, I can clearly state that this course taught me a lot than I expected. 
I would like to summerize things I appreciate and things I didn't like during the course period. 

#### Things I appreciate
* Self studying - It was bit challanging in the begining since the lecturer did a very little bit of lecturing about what we were studying but eventually I relaised that it helpes us to gain much more knowledge than we expected. The learning curve was slow but steady. Unlike some broing monotonus lectures, I won't forget the course content here as I had to actively engage all the time. Morover, lectuer always guided us whever we faced a hitch in the flow, so that it took us some time but later on everybody was pretty much adopted to that teaching style.
* Trying out new things- Lecturer always encouraged us to try out the study material by overselfs and go beyond that. There were no bounderies in learning this subject and that made things more intereting over the time.
* Lecturer's interest - The lecturer was always excited and passionate about what he was teaching and that made us from hating the subject to gradually liking it and eventually getting into love with the subject.
* Learning not just IoT - We were supposed to study IoT but over the time we had to try out extra things including installing hundreds of softwares, Writing logs on GitHub, doing certifications, Debates, Presentations, Group projects, Project management and so on. I felt like I learned 2,3 different subjects while doing this single course. 
* Reachability- The thing I appreciate the most is the reachability to the lecturer. Whenever I had doubts, he was ready to answer to all my stupid questions even at late nights. It really encuraged me because I got the feeling that lecturer is so concerned and responsible with that he teaches so why shouldn't I be concerned and responsible for what I learn. 

#### Things I hate (I would rather say difficulties I 'had' in most cases)
* It took us some time to get into the phase of other groups due to the fact that we were bit unfamiliar with the technologies. 
* We were not the best with coding so we had to give an extra effort on learning those stuff to do NodeRed stuff.
* I personally hate electronics, so initially it was difficut for me to set up a simple practial work. Later on with the help of Rosemary, I could manage those set ups. Eventually realised that it was somethng simple that I didn't know. 
* I always had to work with Rosemary with the same Pi, which gave us so much difficulties. I have described them on the lecture logs seperetly.
* At times, it was difficult to glue all the team members when reaching common goals.
