### Things completed on the practical session: <a name= "Practical_session"></a>
* 1.Installation of raspaberry pi from a pre-installed image. Use class 10 SD card to flash. 
(Had to use specific configuration since it was MacOS to fix bugs before ssh,
.profile
display
)
(https://github.com/ulno/ulnoiot)

### Steps:

1. Downloaded the pre-prepared Raspberry Pi image & wrote the image to a sd-card with https://etcher.io/ . (Use at least 8GB class-10 sd-card)

* Issue Faced: System not detecting the sd-card even after several trials.

* Solution: Used another card-reader and it worked fine.

* Challenge: It took a long time to do the first initialization. Was successful after several attempts. Didn't take down the notes as I was more involved with the practical work while Rosmary was recording the steps we followed. Later she helped with the notes. 

* Changed values:

* uiot_ap_name: smarthome
* uiot_ap_password: internetofthings123
* Put the sd-card into a Raspberry Pi 3 and powered it up. Also connected the LAN cable to it for internet.

* Connected the laptop and mobile to this wifi network.

* Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh ssh -X pi@192.168.12.1 and password ulnoiot. Upgraded it.

* Run the command ulnoiot upgrade to make sure that the latest version of ulnoiot is used.

* 2.Configure passwordless SSH access. 
(https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) 

* Issue Faced: Had to fix a bug in MacOS ssh

* Solution: .profile display :0

* Alternative Solution: Just Restart the Mac

3. Learning Markdown syntax for creating Git logs
