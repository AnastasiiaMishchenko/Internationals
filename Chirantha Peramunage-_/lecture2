Practical session:

sudo reboot

Copy the folder lib/system_templates to a project directory, you can rename system_templates to a project name (i.e. iot-test-project)
Rename the included node_template to a name for the node you want to configure (i.e. onboard_blinker)

difficulties faced:
created my folder in the wrong place intially. Didn't know the exact location to copy and move.
created 2 nodes intially instead of one before even flashing the usb device. So couldn't indetify the exact node for the device. 
Since the device was not flashed correctly, the command to check which devices are connected (console_serial help) didn't work failing it connect to internet.

Commands used:

to Quit: ctrl+[ (alt+5)

to access device: pwd
then cd iot-
cd iot chika/
cd node

console_serial
to configure pi: cat("config.py") - but since the flashing has not done yet, this was aborted. 

Then reconfigure the device without flashing:
pwd
iot-chika
cd node1
initialize - to flash wemos d1 mini. 

ctrl a + k - to kill window
ctrl a + q - to exit all command windows
ctrl alt 6 on the mac!

first node> pink
second node> yellow
