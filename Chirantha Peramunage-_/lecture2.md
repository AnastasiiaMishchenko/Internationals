* Resources: https://ulno.net/teaching/iot/iot-makers/ 

* Installed matrix for the common chatroom.

**Commands used to edit password and connection name**
* sudo editor/boot/config.txt 
* sudo reboot

**Steps followed**
* Copy the folder lib/system_templates to a project directory, you can rename system_templates to a project name (i.e. iot-test-project)
* Rename the included node_template to a name for the node you want to configure (i.e. onboard_blinker)

**Difficulties faced:**
* created my folder in the wrong place intially. 
* Didn't know the exact location to copy and move.
* created 2 nodes intially instead of one before even flashing the usb device. So couldn't indetify the exact node for the device. 
* Since the device was not flashed correctly, the command to check which devices are connected (console_serial help) didn't work failing it connect to internet.

**Commands used to reslove:**

* to Quit: ctrl+[ (alt+5)

* to access device: pwd
then cd iot-
cd iot chika/
cd node

* console_serial

* to configure pi: cat("config.py") - but since the flashing has not done yet, this was aborted. 

* Then reconfigure the device without flashing:
pwd
iot-chika
cd node1
initialize - to flash wemos d1 mini. 

**Other useful commands**
ctrl a + k - to kill window
ctrl a + q - to exit all command windows
ctrl alt 6 on the mac!
