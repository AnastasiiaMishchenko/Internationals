##### Install Snowboy
* https://snowboy.kitt.ai
* https://github.com/kitt-ai/snowboy
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-SDrN4G4lE
* https://brew.sh - install homebrew 
* http://docs.kitt.ai/snowboy/
* command - /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" on terminal
* password - Mac user pw
* Then - brew install swig portaudio sox
* Since I have a python verson above I guess I don't need to install pip. Anyways, the command 'pip install pyaudio' didn't work on my command prompt. Upgrade command 'pip install -U pip' also didn't work for me. 
* Plug the microphone and run rec t.wav on the bash. It will show some waves when it recognizes voice. 
* Trained and recorded a hotward 'Internationals' on snowboy - https://snowboy.kitt.ai/hotword/20562
* In terminal open Python - type Python
* Did a mistake by skipping the pip installation because it was confusing in the intitial tutorial. A new website helped me with installation and better understanding - https://ben.fogbutter.com/2016/02/15/installing-pip-on-os-x.html
* Running the demo was not working fine with the command - python demo.py snowboy.pmdl
* Tried creating a demo.py on my desktop and access it through terminal but no luck. 
* Issue escalated to the next day.
