### RGB light 
* d("rgb_multi", "rgb1", d7, 10) port, number of leds you want to activate.
* run()
* mqtt_send rgb1/set on 
* mqtt_send rgb1/rgb/set 2 blue
* mqtt_send rgb1/rgb/set red 


### Humidity/ Temperature Sensor. 
* sensoronboardled.init( Pin.OUT) this can be used to identify which node the device belongs to
* onboardled.on()
* onboardled.off()
* dmesg to check the devices connected
* d("dht22", "ht01", d7)
* run()

### Issues faced
* Problmes with nodered - http://192.168.12.1:1880/ is not loading properly. Tried 'ulnoiot upgrade' & restarting the Pi but it wasn't the solution. 
* Checked the wifi config on 'ulnoiot/etc/ulnoiot.conf' 
* tried pining and shows no packet losses. also the channel is set to random at ulnoiot/etc/ulnoiot.conf. Tired using a wifi analyser as well. It shows that the wifi has 2 channels, it just uses one though.
* seems like a problem with wifi or either the power supply for the pi.
* used a usb hub to power the pi on. 

# Problem with the power cable gave so much trouble 

### PhotoResistor
* analog, 3V, a0
* d("analog", "photo", threshold=50, precision=5)
* run()


### More issues faced
* nodered is not working properly and the console also shows weird behaviours when 2 devices are connected to the same pi.
* When I tried connecting alone to the pi, the console is working properly but the nodered mqqt inputs keep showing connecting status after deploying a flow.
* Thought of changing mqtt configurations, Tried mqqt manual connection establishment since I had no better options.

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get upgrade
* sudo apt-get install mosquitto - it showed that it already has the lastest version of mosquito, so no luck there.
* Problem was the misconfiguration of the nodered mqtt port. After updating it from 1880 to 1883 it worked. 
* Even after that port fix, often see nodered webpage not working. Then if I poweroff the pi and again try to reconnect I see the below error msg at the first time. "connect to host ulnoiotgw port 22: Network is down". That didn't happen earlier.  
* Also if Rosmary's laptop is connected to the same wifi, the nodered prones to break. If it is just my laptop connected to the wifi, I can perfectly work on NodeRed. No idea why. 
* Every time when I try console_serial on rosy's node, I see this error, on console. 	
* Trouble to init mqtt. Exception: -2
* Trying to connect to mqtt broker. 	
* If I try the same for the second time it opens the console, and then if I check node red, it's already frozen after this. That doesn't happen when I work on my nodes. I don't see such an error. also node red works fine till rosy starts her work logging into same pi. 


#### Send Email nodered.

* https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parsefloat.asp

* var humidityValue = parseFloat(msg.payload);
node.warn("humidity float value " + humidityValue);
if(humidityValue > 1500)
{
    return msg;
}

#### Raindrop/ water sensor
* 3v, analog
* d("analog", "waterr", threshold=300, precision=10)
* run()
* useful links - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RspaltqSVQ

var rain = parseFloat(msg.payload);
node.warn("rain float value " + rain); 

if(rain < 900)
    { 
    return msg;
    }


### Buzzer with the button 
d(“output”, “buzzer”, d7, “off”, “on”)
d("button", "stop", d2, "depressed", "pressed" )
Tried to use it along with photoresistor.

* Fucntion

var photo = parseFloat(msg.payload);
node.warn("photo float value " + photo); 

if(photo > 700)
    { 
    msg.payload = "on";
    return msg;
    }
    
else
    { 
    msg.payload = "off";
    return msg;
    }
    
* Stop buzzer

if(msg.payload === "pressed")
{
    msg.payload = "off"
}
return msg;
    
### Progress 

#### (2 days before final presentation)

* Rosmery finally figured out her nodered issue. 
* I could complete all the functions that I planned to present as my part (Temp/ humidity sensor, raindrop sensor, photoresistor)
* Completed nodered flows. 
* Could integrate darksky weather api to nodered, data is showing in the dashboard although it doens't look as a good UI.
* email alert is receiving for exceeded humidity values.
* Desktop notification is showing for exceeding temperature values.
* Integrated rosmary's buzzer and the button for photoresistor for low values.
* Audio alert has been set up to notify raindrops (wetness level).
