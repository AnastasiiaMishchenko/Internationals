 - cosole serial for via serial connection by the cable connection with the device
 
 
 #UlnoIoT tutorial 2 - Switching A Light
I had troubles while connecting to laptop slot, used another power supplier solved problem.
When I had problem while connecting via console I used serial connection to connect with device.
   console_serial
Use on/off command of the onboardled command
 Test light: onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)
              onboardled.on()
              onboardled.off()
 
#UlnoIoT tutorial 3 - SLed Romote Button
       Go to node one -  cd iot-system-ulno/node1/
       Endup with the device - console
       the command which will use- d("led", "yellow", d7, "turn on", "turn off")
       checking device - devices
       using device["blue"].evaluate("off")/("on")
       then run command - run()
     It listenins commands via network by using protocol mqtt
     
     use help("button") command to see available commands
        b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")
     
        b1.updated_value()
            run()
        mqtt_all - to see both nodes
        mqtt_action - get help (Another uhelp led)
        mqtt_action node2/b1 anychange xyz
        mqtt_send node1/blue/set on
        mqtt_send node1/blue/set off
        mqtt_action node2/b1 anychange xyz mqtt_send node1/blue/set

Started from tutorial 2
ctr+a+t (rename)
checking correct device : dmesg
worked with: console_serial
checked to see comands by typing : dir()
switched light : onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)
light off: onboardled.on() / onboardled.off()

----------------------------
tutorial 3 - Led Remote Button
initalizes node 2 and connected node one also
node1
	d("led", "blue", onboardled, "off", "on")
   check: devices
   devices["blue"].evaluate("on") /("off)
constantly listen: run()

node2 
	help("button")
	b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")
	b1.
	b1. (tab to check commands)
	b1.updated_value()
	run()
new command line
	        mqtt_  (-bash: mqtt_: commant not found)
    but mqtt_all worked
	mqtt_action  (uhelp for more commands)
	mqtt_send node2/b1 anychange xyz
	mqtt_send node1/blue/set on/off (through gateway)
	mqtt_action node2/b1 anychange xyz mqtt_send node1/blue/set
