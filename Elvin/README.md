## Tutorials: <a name="prac"></a>


### 1. Installation on Raspberry Pi<a name="pi"></a>

Downloaded the pre-prepared Raspberry Pi image & wrote the image to a sd-card with https://etcher.io/ .

Note: Use at least 8GB class-10 sd-card (16GB)

Challenge: Time consuming

Changed values:
- uiot_ap_name: eni313
- uiot_ap_password: internetofthings123

First laptop didn't find wifi and connected mobile to this wifi network.

Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh ssh -X pi@192.168.12.1 and password ulnoiot.

command ulnoiot upgrade to make sure that the latest version of ulnoiot is used.

- cosole serial for via serial connection by the cable connection with the device


#UlnoIoT tutorial 2 - Switching A Light
I had troubles while connecting to laptop slot, used another power supplier solved problem.
When I had problem while connecting via console I used serial connection to connect with device.
console_serial
Use on/off command of the onboardled command
Test light: onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)
onboardled.on()
onboardled.off()

#UlnoIoT tutorial 3 - SLed Romote Button
Go to node one -  cd iot-system-ulno/node1/
Endup with the device - console
the command which will use- d("led", "yellow", d7, "turn on", "turn off")
checking device - devices
using device["blue"].evaluate("off")/("on")
then run command - run()
It listenins commands via network by using protocol mqtt

use help("button") command to see available commands
b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")

b1.updated_value()
run()
mqtt_all - to see both nodes
mqtt_action - get help (Another uhelp led)
mqtt_action node2/b1 anychange xyz
mqtt_send node1/blue/set on
mqtt_send node1/blue/set off
mqtt_action node2/b1 anychange xyz mqtt_send node1/blue/set

File "uiot/_mgr.py", line 51, in d
File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: no module named 'uiot.mfrc522

"mfrc522" works when I test with my team mates pi.
copied and initialized another node, still could not solved

Suggestion from professor worked: Try your team mates sd-card in your pi and initialize from there.

                            Debate Part

## Debate:<a name="deb"></a>

* 0. The first and most obvious benefit to smart homes is convenience, as more connected devices can handle more operations (lighting, temperature, etc.) and frees up the resident to perform other tasks. Imagine that you're driving home on a hot summer day. But rather than turn the air conditioner on when you get home and wait for your house to cool, you simply use your smart-phone when you leave your office to tell your smart thermostat to lower the temperature.

* 1. Managing all of your home devices from one place. The convenience factor here is enormous. Being able to keep all of the technology in your home connected through one interface is a massive step forward for technology and home management. Theoretically, all you’ll have to do is learn how to use one app on your smart phone and tablet, and you’ll be able to tap into countless functions and devices throughout your home. --This cuts way back on the learning curve for new users, makes it easier to access the functionality you truly want for your home
* 2. Flexibility for new devices and appliances. Smart home systems tend to be wonderfully flexible when it comes to the accommodation of new devices and appliances and other technology. No matter how state-of-the-art your appliances seem today, there will be newer, more impressive models developed as time goes on. Beyond that, you’ll probably add to your suite of devices as you replace the older ones or discover new technology to accompany your indoor and outdoor spaces. Being able to integrate these newcomers seamlessly will make your job as a homeowner much easier, and allow you to keep upgrading to the latest lifestyle technology.
* 3. Maximizing home security. When you incorporate security and surveillance features in your smart home network, your home security can skyrocket. There are tons of options here -- only a few dozen of which are currently being explored. For example, home automation systems can connect motion detectors, surveillance cameras, automated door locks, and other tangible security measures throughout your home so you can activate them from one mobile device before heading to bed. You can also choose to receive security alerts on your various devices depending on the time of day an alert goes off, and monitor activities in real-time whether you’re in the house or halfway around the globe.

## [openHAB2](#hab)

* Installation

- Choose between the Stable Version Download or the latest Snapshot Version Download of openHAB.

- Unzip the file in your chosen directory (e.g. C:\openHAB2)
- Start the server: Launch the runtime by executing the script C:\openHAB2\start.bat and wait a while for it to start and complete.
- Point your browser to http://localhost:8080. You should be looking at the openHAB package selection page. When you’ve selected an appropriate package, this page will contain the UI selection screen

* Backup

- Make sure that you make regular backups of the conf and userdata folders, you can zip and unzip these folders too and from openHAB installations

* Updating the openHAB Runtime
- There is currently no automatic update script for Windows. To update manually, download a later version of the openHAB distribution zip file and follow these steps:

- Stop the openHAB process if it is currently running.

- Backup openHAB as described above.

Delete the following files and folders from your existing install:

userdata\etc\all.policy
userdata\etc\branding.properties
userdata\etc\branding-ssh.properties
userdata\etc\config.properties
userdata\etc\custom.properties
userdata\etc\distribution.info
userdata\etc\jre.properties
userdata\etc\org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg
userdata\etc\profile.cfg
userdata\etc\startup.properties
userdata\etc\version.properties
userdata\etc\system.properties
userdata\etc\custom.system.properties
Any file in userdata\etc that starts with org.apache.karaf
The userdata\cache folder
The userdata\tmp folder
The runtime folder

- Copy and paste the contents of the zip file over your existing install, when prompted do not overwrite existing files

* Starting openHAB as a Service

- By installing the openHAB process as a service in Windows, you can:
- Launch it automatically upon system startup
- Run it in the background

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 4/10/2018

- Task plips lamb, program pi interntet as a output, and give it as wifi

[KNX lecture](#knx)

- [source knx](https://my.knx.org/)

- [source kodi](https://kodi.tv/)

- Mqtty simulator (build device you don't have
example: automation, temprature going up-down simiulator

## [KNX lecture](#knx)
Basically, a KNX system requires the following components:
* Power Supply for the power of the installation
Sensors (push buttons, thermostats, air speed meters etc.) that generate commands as telegrams
Actuators (switch relays for lights, blinds etc.) that receive the telegrams and perform certain actions
The BUS that connects all Sensors and Actuators

* After the installation has been successfully completed, we need to import a catalog with the device informations, before we can actually start with our first project. Have a look at the video how to handle this task in ETS5.

       return msg;
      
**Note** : Chirantha and Anastasiia used **Active Buzzer** + **Button** as alarm system and the system to stop the alarm respectively, for their project.

We tried to use voice command to stop the alarm but since the noise of Buzzer is high the Snowboy Hotword could not be detected.




* My Final Scenario


Later, Paul wakes up during the night as he is not feeling sleepy. And he wants to eat something wo he is going to kitchen to eat. Then He activates Midnight command which  just activates Kodi movie player and it plays calm music which it will help him to feel sleepy again..
