 ## Q3: IoT definition
 **Definition:**
 this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). It is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure.
 
 **Domains:**
 - Healthcare - Monitor hand hygiene compliance through IOT device and sensors to reduce transmission of Hospital Acquired Infections to patients.
 - Transport and logistics - Monitoring the logistics vehicles health to send alerts.
 - Retail - Remote interaction with products increase personalized shopping experience.
 - Insurance - Tracking clients' activity and offer discounts or rewards for healthy and safe behavior.
 - Banking - Smart payments.
 - Space - MARS Rover.
 - Construction and Real Estate - Smart home devices/locks/camera/security.
 - Farming - Tracking soil health and climate.
 - Industrial internet - Smart Fleet management and more sensors/data in Aircraft to avoid failures.
 - Wearables - Health monitoring and Fitness tracking.

 **Devices:**
 - Fitness trackers
 - Smart lock
 - Smart phoones
 - Smart grids
 - Bluetooth tracker
 - Wifi lighting
 - Thermostats
 - Light ballb
 - Home Energy Monitors

 ## Q4: Installation on Raspberry Pi from Pre-Prepared Image
 1. Download the image.
 2. Check the sha256-cheksum of the image with a comand ```shasum -a 256 ulnoiot-pi.img.xz```.  </br>
 **Note:** I applied the command to the unpacked image which lead to the different checksum.
 3. Install the iTerm2 and XQuartz.
 4. In the file config.txt set up ```uiot_ap_name``` and ```uiot_ap_password``` to the ```International``` and ```MC509SS18```.  </br>
 **Note:** At first I changed the wrong parameters: ``uiot_wifi_name``` and ```uiot_wifi_password``` and set up the password which is shorter than 8 chracters. These leds to the result, that the WiFi was not in the list of wifis.
 5. Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh ```ssh -X pi@192.168.12.1``` and password ```ulnoiot```.
 6. Run the command ```ulnoiot upgrade``` to make sure that the latest version of ulnoiot is used.

 ## Q5: Remove the password
 1. Get to the ssh folder ```cd .ssh/```.
 2. Show the password ```cat id_rsa.pub```.
 3. Copy it to the clipboard. </br>
 **Note:** the first try failed because I did not copy the “ssh-rsa” as part of the key.
 4. Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh.
 5. Edit the ```authorized_key``` file with the command ```editor .ssh/authorized_keys```.
 6. Set the read and write permission ```chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys```. </br>
 **Note:** after the removing of the password, I still need to unter my keychan password to log in.

 ## Q6: First IoT Nodes
 1. Create a folder ```mkdir assignment_light```. 
 2. Copy the file ```cp –R /home/pi/ulnoiot/lib/system_template/ /home/pi/ulnoiot/assignment_light/```.
 3. Rename the directory “system_template” ```mv “system_template” “iot-light” ```.
 4. Rename the directory “node_template” ```mv “node_template” “onboard_blinker”```.
 5. Get into the derectory ```cd onboard_blinker```.
 6. Initialize a current node ```initialized```.
 7. Access the command prompt ```console```. </br>
 **Note:** after the performed commands the microcontroler was not detected, so it was unpluged and pluged in again, the problem was still the same. As a result, it turned out that the problem was in a cabel which is not working.
 8. Initialize the onboardled ```onboardled.init( Pin.OUT )```.
 9. Use commands ```onboardled.off()``` and  ```onboardled.on()``` to turn on/off light on a microcontroller.
 10. ```sudo poweroff```  shut down the Raspberry Pi.

## Q6: Light turn on/off
1. Connect a microcontroller which was initialized before, directly to the laptop.
2. Use a command ```console``` to enter the microcontroller.
3. ```d("led", "green", onboardled, "off", "on")``` - initialize the onboard led.
4. ```devices["green"].evaluate("off")``` and ```devices["green"].evaluate("on")``` - turn off/on the led. Activate the device with ```run()``` command.
5. Connect a second micro controller directly to the Raspberry Pi and ```initialized``` it.
6. Use a command ```console_serial``` to enter the micro controller. </br>
 **Note:** the problem was with misunderstanding of commands ```console_serial``` and ```console```. As a result, I always initialize the same micro controller.
7. Create a variable ```b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")``` and ```b1.update_value()``` to see the changes while pressing the button. Activate the device with ```run()``` command.
8. ```mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set on``` and ```mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set off``` will send the request over the gateway to the led in onboard_blinker_2 directory.
9. ```mqtt_action onboard_blinker/b1 anychange abc mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set``` will send the switch on/off request over the gateway to the led in onboard_blinker_2 directory when the button from the onboard_blinker directory is pressed. 
10. ```sudo poweroff```  shut down the Raspberry Pi.
