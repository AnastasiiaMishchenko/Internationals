 ## Q2: Movie time
 **Film 1(Bing Bang Theory)**
 - Scenarios and application domains: 
   - Lighting
   - Privacy
  - Technologies:
    - Using the Internet
  - Feasibility: 
    - Yes (remote control)
  - Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
    - Useless
    - Crazy
    - Not efficient usage of resources, more for fun
    
As for my opinion, the performed action could be implemented in a real life. It would probably won't be so fast (responce) but it is complitely useless use of resources. </br>
     
   **Film 2(Semens)**
   - Scenarios and application domains: 
     - Security and safety
     - Optamized usage of Energy
     - Energy cooperation with other fields except distribution
     - Dynamic statistic collecting and usage
     - Safe ecvacuation
     - Exchange information in a real time
     - Parking
   - Technologies:
     - Intelligent networks
     - Lighting and voice guidense 
     - Holographic displays
     - Smart grids
     - Sensors (on floors, security sensors)
     - Elevators
     - Electric cars
   - Feasibility: 
     - Not yet (Holographic display, elavators, sensors on a floors)
     - Possible (electric cars, smart grids, lighting and voice guidance)
   - Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
     - No
     
In my opinion, the film loos way to "future". Some of the parts are pretty cool, like analyzing system for the rescuers  to analyze the situation during the fire, for example and react more efficient but it is still not so up to date right now.</br> 
     
   **Film 3(The Internet of Scrimps)**
   - Scenarios and application domains: 
     - Control lights
     - Serves drinks
     - Safety
     - Organize incoming calls and social medias
   - Technologies:
     - Voice control system
     - Social networks 
     - Internet
     - Cell phone
     - Tablet
     - Intelligent Fridge
   - Feasibility: 
     - Not yet (drinking maschine)
     - Yes
   - Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
     - No
     - Yes (playing music on a kitchen supplies)
     
The film by itself is pretty funny but a bit stupid at the same time.  I could not come up with an idea in which life situation I will need such feature as  playing the music over the kitchen supplies. </br>

 ## Q4: Installation on Raspberry Pi from Pre-Prepared Image
 1. Download the image.
 2. Check the sha256-cheksum of the image with a comand ```shasum -a 256 ulnoiot-pi.img.xz```.  </br>
 **Note:** I applied the command to the unpacked image which lead to the different checksum.
 3. Install the iTerm2 and XQuartz.
 4. In the file config.txt set up ```uiot_ap_name``` and ```uiot_ap_password``` to the ```MC509``` and ```MC509SS2018```.  </br>
 **Note:** At first I changed the wrong parameters: ```uiot_wifi_name``` and ```uiot_wifi_password``` and set up the password which is shorter than 8 chracters. These leds to the result, that the WiFi was not in the list of wifis.
 5. Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh ```ssh -X pi@192.168.12.1``` and password ```ulnoiot```.
 6. Run the command ```ulnoiot upgrade``` to make sure that the latest version of ulnoiot is used.
 
 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
 
 <a name="q5"></a>
 ## Q5: Remove the password
 1. Get to the ssh folder ```cd .ssh/```.
 2. Show the password ```cat id_rsa.pub```.
 3. Copy it to the clipboard. </br>
 **Note:** the first try failed because I did not copy the “ssh-rsa” as part of the key.
 4. Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh.
 5. Edit the ```authorized_key``` file with the command ```editor .ssh/authorized_keys```.
 6. Set the read and write permission ```chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys```. </br>
 **Note:** after the removing of the password, I still need to unter my keychan password to log in.

 ## Q6: First IoT Nodes
 1. Create a folder ```mkdir assignment_light```. 
 2. Copy the file ```cp –R /home/pi/ulnoiot/lib/system_template/ /home/pi/ulnoiot/assignment_light/```.
 3. Rename the directory “system_template” ```mv “system_template” “iot-light” ```.
 4. Rename the directory “node_template” ```mv “node_template” “onboard_blinker”```.
 5. Get into the derectory ```cd onboard_blinker```.
 6. Initialize a current node ```initialized```.
 7. Access the command prompt ```console```. </br>
 **Note:** after the performed commands the microcontroler was not detected, so it was unpluged and pluged in again, the problem was still the same. As a result, it turned out that the problem was in a cabel which is not working.
 8. Initialize the onboardled ```onboardled.init( Pin.OUT )```.
 9. Use commands ```onboardled.off()``` and  ```onboardled.on()``` to turn on/off light on a microcontroller.
 10. ```sudo poweroff```  shut down the Raspberry Pi.
 
 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
 
<a name="q7"></a>
## Q7: Light turn on/off
1. Connect a microcontroller which was initialized before, directly to the laptop.
2. Use a command ```console``` to enter the microcontroller.
3. ```d("led", "green", onboardled, "off", "on")``` - initialize the onboard led.
4. ```devices["green"].evaluate("off")``` and ```devices["green"].evaluate("on")``` - turn off/on the led. Activate the device with ```run()``` command.
5. Connect a second micro controller directly to the Raspberry Pi and ```initialized``` it.
6. Use a command ```console_serial``` to enter the micro controller. </br>
 **Note:** the problem was with misunderstanding of commands ```console_serial``` and ```console```. As a result, I always initialize the same micro controller.
7. Create a variable ```b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")``` and ```b1.updated_value()``` to see the changes while pressing the button. Activate the device with ```run()``` command.
8. ```mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set on``` and ```mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set off``` will send the request over the gateway to the led in onboard_blinker_2 directory.
9. ```mqtt_action onboard_blinker/b1 anychange abc mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set``` will send the switch on/off request over the gateway to the led in onboard_blinker_2 directory when the button from the onboard_blinker directory is pressed. 
10. ```sudo poweroff```  shut down the Raspberry Pi.

After performing the commands manually, the ``` autostart.py``` files of both microcontrollers were modified. For the microcontroller which performs on and off of the led, the following lines were added. 

```python
d("led", "green", onboardled, "off", "on")
devices["green"].evaluate("off")
devices["green"].evaluate("on")
run(10)
```

For the microcontroller which performs the button clicks, the following lines were added.

```python
b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")
b1.updated_value()
run(10)
```

After, we can use the command ```deploy noupdate``` from the node folder to run the ```autoupdate.py``` file.

 ## Q9: Home Automation Debate: Everybody should use Home Automation. True or False?
 
Our team was indicated as a pros team during the debates. After the analyzing of the information from the Internet we came up with 4 specific topics:
1. After reading this article about mobile apps which combine security and home functionality, so I would like to discuss the security (remotely monitoring) and the installation of the system.
2. Also, we would like to discuss, the market impact of home and building automation. Power consumption by energy saving devices. (Article: “Home automation market growth demand and key players to 2015-2025”).
3. In “Roseville Eskaton deploys home automation tablets for residents” article, it was stated that senior living apartments will turn into smart homes allowing each resident to manage their day-to-day activities. That’s why we want to discuss learning curve and easiness of usage for everyone. 
4. Variation of the devices which provides security, flexibility, and centralized control.

Nevertheless, we also have a more extended list of general topics which we also take a look at during the preparation for debates:
- Security
- Energy efficiency.
- Compatibility and flexibility of the systems.
- Costs and savings.
- Environmental impact.
- Reliability.
- The complexity of the system.
- Entertainment.
- Monitoring/ device management.

Despite the fact that I belong to the pros team, personally, I cannot fully agree with the statement that home automatization should be in each house. We cannot ignore the fact that according to the global analysis and forecast “Home Automation Market to 2025 " published on November 2017, global home automation system market is expected to grow from US$ 35.24 billion in 2016 to US$ 113.82 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.93% between 2017 and 2025.  This is the strong shos that it is a dynamic industry which is financed and develop rapidly. Another driving force is: 
- increasing usage of smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices increasing penetration of Internet 
- growing awareness of energy consumption and energy management building infrastructure 
- growing number of residential projects  
- growing need for remote home monitoring solutions  

I think, that there is still a high issue with security, in case of hacking of your system, other people could get exes to private information and your timetable which could lead to much worse problems later. Another point is the geographical inequality, according to the global analysis and forecast “Home Automation Market to 2025 ", North America dominates Global home automation market. It captures approximately 40% of the total market share closely followed by Europe. Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at the highest CAGR due to increasing building infrastructure at a significant rate and growing number of residential projects. The problem is less awareness among people. If in Europe people are more educated about the background of such systems and techno novety, it could be a challenge in Asia-Pacific where people are more "scared" about the things which are new for them. The last but not the least is the price. The price dropping is expected in following years but according to the current prices, there are some basic costs of installing home automation:
- Basic starter kit (lights or deadbolt controls): $40 to $500.
- Wireless mesh systems (Z-Wave, etc.): $300 to $600.
- Monthly service: $35 to $70 per month, plus activation fees, which normally cost around $200 to $500. Equipment is usually free.
- Cloud automation – $179 to $299.
- Hardwired – Unlike the above choices, which simply plug into your existing outlets, hardwired systems become part of your home. Hardwired systems are much more reliable and cost from $3,000 to $15,000 to install.

In general, the cost to have a professional install your system is around $85 an hour. Most homeowners can install plug-in systems, but it’s best to have a professional install hard-wired systems.

 ## Q11: NFC reader & smart lock
 
**Note** The biggest mistake was to flash again the Py instead of running the ```ulnoiot upgrade```. As a result, I start all over again.

In **HIGH** if there is some input voltage – the circuit will close, if not – means the circuit is open
In **LOW** would be the opposite. 

**GND** would be –
**VCC** would be +
**SIG** signal would be connected via breadboard

1. To start, I try to maintain the smart lock with a button.
2. First of all, unscrew the screw-bolts.
3. When button is pressed – the lock is open (indicated with a led on a 5 pin relay).
![Structure](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/IMG_0224.JPG)

After I procedure to the next task, connect smart lock with nfc reader.

1. Create a reader. 
```python
r = d("mfrc522","reader",d0)
run()
```
