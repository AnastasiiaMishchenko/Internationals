   - Lighting
   - Privacy
  - Technologies:
    - Using the Internet
  - Feasibility: 
    - Yes (remote control)
  - Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
    - Useless
    - Crazy
    - Not efficient usage of resources, more for fun
    
As for my opinion, the performed action could be implemented in a real life. It would probably won't be so fast (responce) but it is complitely useless use of resources. </br>
     
   **Film 2(Semens)**
   - Scenarios and application domains: 
     - Security and safety
     - Optamized usage of Energy
     - Energy cooperation with other fields except distribution

     - Possible (electric cars, smart grids, lighting and voice guidance)
   - Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
     - No
     
In my opinion, the film loos way to "future". Some of the parts are pretty cool, like analyzing system for the rescuers  to analyze the situation during the fire, for example and react more efficient but it is still not so up to date right now.</br> 
     
   **Film 3(The Internet of Scrimps)**
   - Scenarios and application domains: 
     - Control lights
     - Serves drinks
     - Safety
     - Organize incoming calls and social medias
   - Technologies:
     - Voice control system
     - Social networks 
     - Internet
     - Cell phone
     - Tablet
     - Intelligent Fridge
   - Feasibility: 
     - Not yet (drinking maschine)
     - Yes
   - Weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?):
     - No
     - Yes (playing music on a kitchen supplies)
     
The film by itself is pretty funny but a bit stupid at the same time.  I could not come up with an idea in which life situation I will need such feature as  playing the music over the kitchen supplies. </br>

 ## Q4: Installation on Raspberry Pi from Pre-Prepared Image
 1. Download the image.
 2. Check the sha256-cheksum of the image with a comand ```shasum -a 256 ulnoiot-pi.img.xz```.  </br>
 **Note:** I applied the command to the unpacked image which lead to the different checksum.
 3. Install the iTerm2 and XQuartz.
 4. In the file config.txt set up ```uiot_ap_name``` and ```uiot_ap_password``` to the ```MC509``` and ```MC509SS2018```.  </br>
 **Note:** At first I changed the wrong parameters: ```uiot_wifi_name``` and ```uiot_wifi_password``` and set up the password which is shorter than 8 chracters. These leds to the result, that the WiFi was not in the list of wifis.
 5. Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh ```ssh -X pi@192.168.12.1``` and password ```ulnoiot```.
 6. Run the command ```ulnoiot upgrade``` to make sure that the latest version of ulnoiot is used.
 
 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
 
 <a name="q5"></a>
 ## Q5: Remove the password
 1. Get to the ssh folder ```cd .ssh/```.
 2. Show the password ```cat id_rsa.pub```.
 3. Copy it to the clipboard. </br>
 **Note:** the first try failed because I did not copy the “ssh-rsa” as part of the key.
 4. Connect to the ulnoiotgw via ssh.
 5. Edit the ```authorized_key``` file with the command ```editor .ssh/authorized_keys```.
 6. Set the read and write permission ```chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys```. </br>
 **Note:** after the removing of the password, I still need to unter my keychan password to log in.
 
 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
 
 <a name="q6"></a>
 ## Q6: First IoT Nodes
 1. Create a folder ```mkdir assignment_light```. 
 2. Copy the file ```cp –R /home/pi/ulnoiot/lib/system_template/ /home/pi/ulnoiot/assignment_light/```.
 3. Rename the directory “system_template” ```mv “system_template” “iot-light” ```.
 4. Rename the directory “node_template” ```mv “node_template” “onboard_blinker”```.
 5. Get into the derectory ```cd onboard_blinker```.
 6. Initialize a current node ```initialized```.
 7. Access the command prompt ```console```. </br>
 **Note:** after the performed commands the microcontroler was not detected, so it was unpluged and pluged in again, the problem was still the same. As a result, it turned out that the problem was in a cabel which is not working.
 8. Initialize the onboardled ```onboardled.init( Pin.OUT )```.
 9. Use commands ```onboardled.off()``` and  ```onboardled.on()``` to turn on/off light on a microcontroller.
 10. ```sudo poweroff```  shut down the Raspberry Pi.
 
 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
 
<a name="q7"></a>
## Q7: Light turn on/off
1. Connect a microcontroller which was initialized before, directly to the laptop.
2. Use a command ```console``` to enter the microcontroller.
3. ```d("led", "green", onboardled, "off", "on")``` - initialize the onboard led.
4. ```devices["green"].evaluate("off")``` and ```devices["green"].evaluate("on")``` - turn off/on the led. Activate the device with ```run()``` command.
5. Connect a second micro controller directly to the Raspberry Pi and ```initialized``` it.
6. Use a command ```console_serial``` to enter the micro controller. </br>
 **Note:** the problem was with misunderstanding of commands ```console_serial``` and ```console```. As a result, I always initialize the same micro controller.
7. Create a variable ```b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")``` and ```b1.updated_value()``` to see the changes while pressing the button. Activate the device with ```run()``` command.
8. ```mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set on``` and ```mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set off``` will send the request over the gateway to the led in onboard_blinker_2 directory.
9. ```mqtt_action onboard_blinker/b1 anychange abc mqtt_send onboard_blinker_2/green/set``` will send the switch on/off request over the gateway to the led in onboard_blinker_2 directory when the button from the onboard_blinker directory is pressed. 
10. ```sudo poweroff```  shut down the Raspberry Pi.

After performing the commands manually, the ``` autostart.py``` files of both microcontrollers were modified. For the microcontroller which performs on and off of the led, the following lines were added. 

```python
d("led", "green", onboardled, "off", "on")
devices["green"].evaluate("off")
devices["green"].evaluate("on")
run(10)
```

For the microcontroller which performs the button clicks, the following lines were added.

```python
b1 = d("button", "b1", d3, "off", "on")
b1.updated_value()
run(10)
```

After, we can use the command ```deploy noupdate``` from the copy folder to run the ```autoupdate.py``` file.

 ## Q9: Project 1: Home Automation Debate: Everybody should use Home Automation. True or False?
 
Our team was indicated as a pros team during the debates. After the analyzing of the information from the Internet we came up with 4 specific topics:
1. After reading this article about mobile apps which combine security and home functionality, so I would like to discuss the security (remotely monitoring) and the installation of the system.
2. Also, we would like to discuss, the market impact of home and building automation. Power consumption by energy saving devices. (Article: “Home automation market growth demand and key players to 2015-2025”).
3. In “Roseville Eskaton deploys home automation tablets for residents” article, it was stated that senior living apartments will turn into smart homes allowing each resident to manage their day-to-day activities. That’s why we want to discuss learning curve and easiness of usage for everyone. 
4. Variation of the devices which provides security, flexibility, and centralized control.

Nevertheless, we also have a more extended list of general topics which we also take a look at during the preparation for debates:
- Security
- Energy efficiency.
- Compatibility and flexibility of the systems.
- Costs and savings.
- Environmental impact.
- Reliability.
- The complexity of the system.
- Entertainment.
- Monitoring/ device management.

Despite the fact that I belong to the pros team, personally, I cannot fully agree with the statement that home automatization should be in each house. We cannot ignore the fact that according to the global analysis and forecast “Home Automation Market to 2025 " published on November 2017, global home automation system market is expected to grow from US$ 35.24 billion in 2016 to US$ 113.82 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.93% between 2017 and 2025.  This is the strong shos that it is a dynamic industry which is financed and develop rapidly. Another driving force is: 
- increasing usage of smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices increasing penetration of Internet 
- growing awareness of energy consumption and energy management building infrastructure 
- growing number of residential projects  
- growing need for remote home monitoring solutions  

I think, that there is still a high issue with security, in case of hacking of your system, other people could get exes to private information and your timetable which could lead to much worse problems later. Another point is the geographical inequality, according to the global analysis and forecast “Home Automation Market to 2025 ", North America dominates Global home automation market. It captures approximately 40% of the total market share closely followed by Europe. Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at the highest CAGR due to increasing building infrastructure at a significant rate and growing number of residential projects. The problem is less awareness among people. If in Europe people are more educated about the background of such systems and techno novety, it could be a challenge in Asia-Pacific where people are more "scared" about the things which are new for them. The last but not the least is the price. The price dropping is expected in following years but according to the current prices, there are some basic costs of installing home automation:
- Basic starter kit (lights or deadbolt controls): $40 to $500.
- Wireless mesh systems (Z-Wave, etc.): $300 to $600.
- Monthly service: $35 to $70 per month, plus activation fees, which normally cost around $200 to $500. Equipment is usually free.
- Cloud automation – $179 to $299.
- Hardwired – Unlike the above choices, which simply plug into your existing outlets, hardwired systems become part of your home. Hardwired systems are much more reliable and cost from $3,000 to $15,000 to install.

In general, the cost to have a professional install your system is around $85 an hour. Most homeowners can install plug-in systems, but it’s best to have a professional install hard-wired systems.

- Advantages of 1-wire interface
  * Following are the benefits or advantages of 1-wire interface:
    * Multiple slaves are accessed using only 2-wires in this interface type. 
    * Due to use of less wires, the interface is cheaper. 
    * It is easy to implement the interface. 
    * The interface supports longer distance (about 300 meters)
  * Disadvantages of 1-wire interface:
    * It is implemented both in the hardware as well as software. The synchronization of data at the receiver has to be taken care in software which is a complex task. 
    * Though the interface supports longer distance, it is limited due to noise and cable capacitance.

 ## Q11: NFC reader & smart lock
 
**Note** The biggest mistake was to flash again the Py instead of running the ```ulnoiot upgrade```. As a result, I start all over again.

In **HIGH** if there is some input voltage – the circuit will close, if not – means the circuit is open
In **LOW** would be the opposite. 

- **GND** would be –
- **VCC** would be +
- **SIG** signal would be connected via breadboard

1. To start, I try to maintain the smart lock with a button.
2. First of all, unscrew the screw-bolts.
3. When button is pressed – the lock is open (indicated with a led on a 5 pin relay).
![Structure](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/IMG_0224.JPG)

After I procedure to the next task, connect smart lock with nfc reader.

1. Create a reader. 
```python
r = d("mfrc522","reader",d0)
run()
```
2. Create a smart_lock
```python
d(“out”, “smart_lock”, d0, “off”, “on”)
devices[“smart_lock”].evaluate(“off”)
devices[“smart_lock”].evaluate(“on”)
run()
```
3. In REDnode:
```python
var idArray= msg.payload.split(" ");
var id = idArray[1];
if(id === "2b71112b60"){
    msg.payload = "on";
}else{
    msg.payload = "off";
}
return msg;
```
4. After receiving the id “2b71112b60” send a message to a lock to set it as on, if not - off.
![REDnode](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-10%20at%2011.47.23.png)

 ## Q13: KNX
 
KNX is a standardized communication protocol for intelligent buildings. KNX is the successor of three previous standards: the European Home Systems Protocol (EHS), BatiBUS, and the European Installation Bus (EIB or Instabus). 

In contrast to a standard electric installation, there is no hard wired connection between the control units and the power supply, for example a light switch is not directly connected with the respective light. Instead, devices and electric assets are connected via the BUS which runs on 29 Volts. All BUS devices can be programmed with one common tool, thus the KNX BUS allows an easy and very flexible installation, and even subsequent changes can be done easily without changing the wiring.

Basically, a KNX system requires the following components:
- Power Supply for the power of the installation
- Sensors (push buttons, thermostats, air speed meters etc.) that generate commands as telegrams
- Actuators (switch relays for lights, blinds etc.) that receive the telegrams and perform certain actions
- The BUS that connects all Sensors and Actuators

The smallest entity within the KNX topology is a line, respectively a line segment. A line can contain a maximum of 64 devices. This is enough for most small scale projects. For bigger projects, up to 15 lines can be combined within one area - connected via a main line. Different lines may be connected to the main line with a Line Coupler. 

Furthermore, it is also possible to connect up to 15 areas to a backbone. Single areas are connected to the backbone line via a Backbone Coupler. KNX end devices may be connected anywhere in this topology. Up to 255 KNX end devices may be addressed in any sub- network. KNX end devices may be numbered from 1 to 255. But KNX end devices may NOT have device number 0. 

Each KNX device (Backbone Coupler, Line Coupler, KNX end device ...) must have an Individual Address. This Individual Address is unique throughout the complete topology.

 ## Q15: Temperature/humidity sensor
 1. Connect the sensor
 2. Modify the autostart.py
 ```python
 d(“dht11”, “th”, d1)
 run()
 ```
  **NOTE:** As far as I used a wrong sensor, got some errors. 
  
  In REDnode:
  ![Temperature](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/temperature.png)
  1. Set the topic to the mqtt input
  2. Connect it with gauage and chart to represent the data

 ## Q16: Water sensor sensor
 1. Connect the sensor
 2. Modify the autostart.py
 ```phyton
 d(“analog”, “water”, precision=10)
 run()
 ```
 We don't need **threshold** because it converts analog sensor into a digital.
 We will keep **precision** to get less values. Analog port gives as values from 0 to 1024 for 0 to 1V but we can use it with 3.3V But never use something over this value.

 ## Q17: RGB led  
 1. Connect the sensor
 2. Modify the autostart.py
 ```phyton
 d(“rgb”, “rgb1”, d3, d4, d2)
 run()
 ```
 3. In a node folder set the angle ```mqtt_send rgb1/rgb/set red```

 ## Q19: Display
 ![Display error](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/error_display.png)
 **Note:** turned out that I used the wrong command for my sensor.
 1. In the node 
 ```phyton
 d(“display44780”, “dp1”, d3, d4)
 devices[“dp1”].clear()
 devices[“dp1”].print(“hello”)
 ```
 **Note:** did not work, on the [webpage](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/HD44780.pdf), it stayed that it support from 2.7 to 5V but in reality, it did not work with 3.
 
 2. Change the connections. Use 5V source.
 3. Run the commands from 1. Worked
 4. In the node derictory
 ```phyton
 mqtt_send dp1/set “&&clear”
 mqtt_send dp1/set “hello”
 ```

 ## Q20: Phillips HUE
 Thomas Staltner helped me with configurations.
 
 **Rasberry py**
 incoming – internet 
 outcoming – to the hub
 1. Wire the things out. 
 2. Open the file ```editor ulnoiot/etc/ulnoiot.conf```
 3. Disable the ```ULNOIOT_AP_BRIDGE```
 4. Run ```ulnoiot upgrade```
 5. Update the kernel ```sudo rpi-update```
 6. Enable ```ULNOIOT_AP_BRIDGE=eth0``` in ```ulnoiot.conf```
 7. Reboot the system ```sudo reboot```

 **Note:** The problem was that I connected it to the high priority ports, after switching to the 1 and 2 it starts to work

 8. Connect the black one to the hub directly and through the white one to the Internet. 

 **Note:** It turned out that there is no Internet. As it was identified later, the hub did not work.

 **REDnode**  
 1. Install Palette “node-red-contrib-huemagic”
 2. Create a new bridge.
 3. Go to the app in your cell phone ->Settings->Hue bridges->Info-> get the IP address.
 4. The key is generated by the Philips hue by pressing the button.
 5. After the bridge is constructed -> check it in Hue Light .
 6. In switch -> set the following JSON commands:
 - ```ON payload {"on": true}```
 - ```OFF Payload {"on": false}```

 ## Q21: Project 2: presentation of other groups
 **Presentation MC**
 
 Don’t like: 
 - did not cover pool 
 
 Like: 
 - a personalized situation of the lighting system
 - variety of light systems
 - emergency lighting
 - provide plans where all devices are marked

 The system by itself is pretty expensive. I would like also to add LED strips to our project (used in MC project). The idea of splitting the fields of covering into independent sections makes information  easier to understand. 

 **Presentation ENI**

 Like: 
 - underfloor heating
 - filter model
 - covered cabling (the only group)
 - use PV
 - wiring examples

 I really like the interconnections section, it provides very detail information, which none of another group had. They also provide the information about the protocols to use

 Both of the presentations were focused on connections and hardware by itself which was a drawback of us.

 ## Q22: Snowboy
 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
 
 1. Try ```brew install portaudio sox```
 **Note:** Did not work, provide with tons of errors. One of them was *Error: active developer path ("/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer") does not exist*
 2. To specify the Xcode that you wish to use for command line developer tools ```sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app```
 3. Run ```brew install portaudio sox```
 4. Worked.
 
 To get the snowboydetect.py file:
 1. ```cd ../swig```
 2. ```cd Python```
 3. ```make```

 The demo4.py was modified. Following changes were added:
 1. Set up the MQTT.
 ```phyton
 print "Try to connect to mqtt broker..."
 client = mqtt.Client()
 client.on_publish = on_mqtt_publish
 client.on_connect = on_mqtt_connect

 client.connect("192.168.12.1", 1883, 60)
 client.loop_start()
 ```
 2. Publish the recognized text.
 ```phyton
 myText = r.recognize_google(audio)
 print("Recognized: " + myText)
        
 client.publish("snowboy_dina", payload=myText)
 ```
 3. Delete the recorded file.
 ```phyton
 try:
    os.remove(fname)
 except OSError as e:
    print("Could not delete recorded file. Error code: " + e.code)
 ```
 4. Create a function ```start_listening()```. Call it to start listening again, no matter what happened.
 ```phyton
 def start_listening():
    print "----------------------------------------------"
    print "Listening... Press Ctrl+C to exit"

    detector.start(detected_callback=detectedCallback,
               audio_recorder_callback=audioRecorderCallback,
               interrupt_check=interrupt_callback,
               sleep_time=0.01)
  ```
  5. Create a function unlockVoice in node red to ckeck it.
  ```javascript
  var status = msg.payload;
  if(status == "unlock"){
    msg.payload = "off";
  } else {
    msg.payload = "on"
  }
  return msg;
  ```
  ![Snowboy smartlock](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/voiceRecognition.png)
  Sadly, I forgot to capture the current example, but while testing, I was going with hello world and it was detected and send to the mqtt input snowboy_dina. From the terminal ```python demo4.py Dina.pmdl```
  ![Snowboy dina](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/snowboy_dina.png)
  **Note:** the problem was that I used the wrong port. Instead of  1883, I used 1880. 
 
 Also, this part was used in Rosemary final project node.
  ![Snowboy light](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/lightVoice.png)
  ```javascript
  var status = msg.payload;
  if(status == "light"){
    msg.payload = "on";
  } else {
    msg.payload = "off"
  }
  return msg;
  ```
  Proofs could be found in the final video.
  Also, to try the output, I configure the flow to say and display the status of the door.

 ## Q23: Distance sensor
 **Note:** Has the same problem as Thomas & Mona with the ulnoiot upgrade and update_serial (in the node)

 **ECHO** – d1
 **TRIC** – d2
 **VCC** – 5V

 1. Connect the sensor.
 2. Modify the autostart.py 
 ```phyton
 d(“hcsr04”, “distacne”, d2, d1)
 run()
 ```
 3. The results presented in mm value.

 <div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

 ## Q24: RGB multi led
 1. Connect the sensor.
 2. Modify the autostart.py 
 ```phyton
 d(“rgb_multi”, “rgb_multi”, d1, 10)
 run()
 ```
 3. In the REDnode. turn on/off function
 ```phyton
 var status = msg.payload;
 if(status === true){
    msg.payload = "on";
 }else{
    msg.payload = "off";
    }
 return msg;
 ```

 ## Q25: Project 3:Implementation
 **Note:** the problem after the assignment with Phillips hue, was that I did not comment ```ULNOIOT_AP_BRIDGE```, as a result, I was not able to connect to the Rasberry Pi. To fix it, I connect to the Rasberry Pi over the ethernet cable to the usb0 and change the setting in a ulnoiot.conf file.

 
 ![misconfiguration](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/misconfigured%20pi.png)
 
 While working on the [final project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNgPxt6YeKZw2nUC-A1JZybzCP3lvPduCwLyRmiakKM/edit?usp=sharing), I was responsible for the following:

 1. Voice recognition.
     <div align="left"><a href="#q22">Snowboy part</a></div>
 2. DB
     1. Set up the DB on a Rasberry Pi	```sudo apk-get install sqlite3```.
     
     2. Enter the environment ```sqlite3```
     
     3. Create a DB ```data.db```
     
     4. Create a table.
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     CREATE TABLE residencedata (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, nfc_id TEXT);
     COMMIT;
     ```
     5. Insert data.
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     INSERT INTO residencedata (id, name, nfc_id) values(1, “Paul”, “2b71112b60”);
     COMMIT;
     
     BEGIN;
     INSERT INTO residencedata (id, name, nfc_id) values(2, “Rachel”, “76d77d419d”);
     COMMIT;
     ```
 3. Smart lock & NFC reader</br>
    After, he opens the door with his NFC card and receives a welcome message with his name on a display. According to the current time, the multi led is turned on. 
    
     As a <a href="#q11"> base</a>, I took an assignment which I already did but additionally implement the DB. After, I modified the smart lock & NFC reader flow. Basically now, I send a query to the DB with a given id (NFC  card). If the value match to any of the entity of the DB then the name which is assigned with the current id is returned. msg.payload is modified and set to the display. If no existing nfc_id matched, then the "Access denied" message pass to the display.
     
     ![Unlock scenario](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/unlock%20scenario.png)
     
     select 
     ```javascript
    var idArray = msg.payload.split(" ");
    msg.params = [idArray[1]];
    return msg;
    ```
    
    getName
    ```javascript
    var name = "&&clear" + " Access denied";
    if(msg.payload !== null && msg.payload !== undefined){
    if(msg.payload.length > 0){
        name = "&&clear" + " Hello, " + msg.payload[0]["name"] + "! ";
    }
    }
    msg.payload = name;
    return msg;
    ```
    
    lock
    
    **Note:** the commands are switched because the node was misconfigured
    ```javascript
    var name = msg.payload;
    if(name === "&&clear Access denied"){
    msg.payload = "on";
    }else{
    msg.payload = "off";
    }
    return msg;
    ```
    
    light
    ```javascript
    var hours = new Date().getHours();
    var status = msg.payload;
    if(status === "off" && (hours > 18 || hours < 7)){
    msg.payload = "on";
    }else{
    msg.payload = "off";
    }
    return msg;
    ```
    Also I added a delay function so the message would be sent to the display once per second.
 4. <div align="left"><a href="#q19">Display</a></div>
 5. <div align="left"><a href="#q23">Distance</a></div>
    Paul comes back from work he parks in a garage, the distance sensor identifies the distance and signal if it is too close to the wall. The distance is also shown on a display in front of the car. 
    
    Basically, I collect the date from the distance sensor, as we know, it returns data in mm, so I convert it to the cm and display.
    
    ![Parking scenario](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/parking_scenario.png)
    
    getDistance
    ```javascript
    var distance = Number(msg.payload);
    var cm = distance/10;
    if( cm < 10){
        msg.payload = "&&clear" + " Alert"
    } else if (cm >50){
        msg.payload = "&&clear"
    } else {
        msg.payload = "&&clear" + " distance: " + cm
    }
    return msg;
    ```
    Also I added a delay function so the message would be sent to the display once per second.   
 6. Flame
    
    Meanwhile, Paul wants to cook dinner. He turns on the stove over the touch button. Accidentally, the paper falls on a stove and burn. The flame is detected by the sensor and warn Paul over a display and buzzer is triggered. He goes and checks the kitchen. 
 
    ![Flame scenario](https://github.com/AnastasiiaMishchenko/Internationals/blob/master/Anastasiia%20Mishchenko/Images/flame%20scenario.png)
    
    flameDetection
    ```javascript
       var status = msg.payload;
       if(status == 1){
       msg.payload = "on"
       } else {
          msg.payload = "off";
       } 
       return msg;
    ```
    
    getNotification
    ```javascript
       var status = msg.payload;
       if(status == "on"){
          msg.payload = "&&clear" + " Alert!Fire detected!"
       } else {
          msg.payload = "&&clear"
       }
       return msg;
    ```
    Also I added a delay function so the message would be sent to the display once per second.
